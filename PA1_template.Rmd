#Summary
This document was produced as the first project for Coursera's Reproducible Research course.

## Loading and preprocessing the data
The working directory is set and the data is read from the .csv file. The aggregate() function is used to summarize the data.
```{r, echo = TRUE}
  setwd("/Users/mistermaxx/Documents/work/personal/Coursera/Repro_Res/")
  
  # read data from file
  activity.file.data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
  
  # calc distrubtion of steps
  steps.data <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activity.file.data, sum)

```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
